# Predicting_Mortality_using_BP_in_eICU_dataset
Hack Aotearoa 2020

# Hypothesis
The hypothesis was that blood pressure is a better predictor of mortality than Apache score.
The hypothesis was based on the years of experience of an ICU clinician who collaborated with us on the project.

# Methodology
The clinician believed that the fluctuations in the systolic and diastolic pressures happened to predict the risk to the health of the patient better.
We did some initial analysis to see if the data can provide some insight into this.
We used superlearner package in R to try different algorithms. Random Forest seemed to work best out of all the algorithms we used in terms of accuracy.
We saw the variable importance
